# LinkedIn-webscraper

This python script scrapes LinkedIn profiles for essential info (using Selenium) and stores the data in the results.csv file

To use it, go to parameters.py and enter your LinkedIn login credentials as well as search terms for the profiles. E.g.: "Software Developer" AND "Hong Kong"
Run scraper.py from your terminal and let the magic begin.
(might have to pip install some packages for it to work)

Made as a side-project in September 2020 to learn webscraping.
